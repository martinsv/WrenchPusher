Pusher Client for PHP - Get messages pushed to PHP!

Following the example (index.php) you can see how to make a client in PHP for PusherApp.  This allows you to create long-running daemon scripts and to receive messages pushed into them from PusherApp.  This library is essentially a wrapper for the Client side of Wrench (a great websockets library for PHP).
